        <h2>Preparing to Compete for Miss Universe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><stron>Stay in shape.</stron> Exercise and eat healthy. Remember, Miss Universe contestants are judged on their appearance wearing a bathing suit.</li>
            <li><strong>Pamper your skin.</strong> Don't be afraid to splurge on products that bring out the beauty of your skin, including acne-fighting cleansers and moisturizer. Avoid sun damage by applying sun screen any time you are outdoors.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove unwanted body hair.</strong> Most Miss Universe contestants choose waxing, as the results last for several days.[4] You should wax several days before the pageant, but not so close to the day of the event that your skin is still visibly irritated or red from the waxing. Wax the bikini lines, armpits, legs and mustache (if you have one).</li>
            <li><strong>Work with a pageant coach.</strong> A coach can teach you skills and ways to walk, act and look throughout a pageant. Ask your friends and fellow pageant participants for recommendations. You can also search online at pageant sites to find coaches.</li>
            <li><strong>for your interview.</strong>  Educate yourself and form opinions of current and recent events around the world. Determine your platform, the cause you care most about that you will work toward during your reign should you win the pageant.</li>
